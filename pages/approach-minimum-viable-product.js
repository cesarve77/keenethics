      <p>
        The minimum viable product is a product with a minimum necessary set of features, which is developed in a short 
        period of time. The idea of MVP software development is to test the viability of your product idea — to see if the 
        market needs it, if the users like it, and how you can improve it. This lets you make sure that your product will be 
        competitive before you actually start investing in full-scaled software product development. Along with proof of 
        concept development,&nbsp;

        <p>
          The idea of this iOS app is to simplify and improve the quality of cancer survivors’ lives. The minimum viable product 
          development showed that it will be the first chatbot-based mobile app in the field of Integrative Oncology. The goal 
          of it is impressive —  to educate people who successfully fought cancer and those who take care of them about how 
          to prevent disease recurrence. We are proud to have been involved in such a socially significant project.

        Ideally, MVP development services start with product discovery and go through prototyping before we 
        start developing the MVP itself. However, if you have already completed the discovery and prototyping stages yourself or 
        with a different agency, we will gladly continue from where you left.

          <h3>Decisive</h3>
          <p>
            A minimum viable product is a chance to test the viability of your business idea and to decide whether it is worth 
            implementing. At the same time, the MVP approach minimizes the business risk you may face while developing 
            your idea. So, MVP helps you decide if your idea is worth a shot.

          <h3>Resource-efficient</h3>
          <p>
          The minimum viable product development takes about 6 times less time and resources than the development of a 
          full app. Thus, it saves you a lot of effort and time. If your idea is not viable, you do not lose a lot. If your idea is 
          viable, you will have enough resources to launch the development.

            Since a minimum viable product is fast and easy to develop, you will get a chance to demonstrate your product to 
            the investors and sponsors sooner. This will help you persuade stakeholders to support your project and to secure 
            another round of investment.
