    When developing a native app, you have to wait for a build to finish to see the results

    you can see changes as soon as you press “Save”, which makes the development faster.

        <h2>What Is React Native Application Development?</h2>
        <p>
          There are two target audiences that the mobile app
          owner should aim at, – Android users and iOS
          users, – and neither one can be ignored.
          Developing a separate app for each platform is time-consuming, inconvenient,
          and expensive. React Native solves this problem.
          By offering the opportunity for cross-platform development,
          React Native greatly reduces the amount of resources
          needed for the development of Android and iOS apps without compromising the app quality.
        </p>
        <p>
          React Native is a JavaScript-based cross-platform mobile app development
          framework. 95% of React Native codebase is shared by iOS and Android apps. Moreover,
          some business logic of a web app written in React can be reused
          with the help of React Native application development.
          It is faster, more effective, and more convenient.

          <p className="text-bold text-center">ParkQX</p>
          <p>
            ParkQX is a mobile application aimed to facilitate the parking
            routine and to spare the unnecessary hustle.
            On the one hand, it helps drivers find, book,
            and pay for a parking spot in a few simple taps. On the other hand,
            it helps parking spot owners profit from their unused parking space. This
            mobile solution has the potential to improve
            the transport and parking situation in any city.
