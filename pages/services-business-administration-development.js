          <h2>What is Business Administration?</h2>
          <p>
            Managing and developing a successful business requires you as a business owner
            to put a great deal of effort almost 24/7. To save yourself some time and energy,
            you hire a team of people. Some business responsibilities you delegate include: HR,
            marketing, accounting, analysis and reporting, security, task and resource management.
            To facilitate business growth even further, you develop various software solutions
            and integrate them into your business system. HR management platforms, accounting
            systems, security solutions, or task management platforms â€“ these aim to improve your
            business performance and productivity by sparing some routine tasks.
