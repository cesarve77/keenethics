          <h2>What Is PhoneGap and Cordova?</h2>
          <p>
            Cordova, also known as Apache Cordova, is a cross-platform mobile
            app development framework, which was introduced in 2009. PhoneGap is
            the most popular distribution of Apache Cordova. PhoneGap and
            Cordova can be used interchangeably — there is basically only one
            difference between them. Cordova is free and open source, and so is
            PhoneGap, but the latter belongs to Adobe. If for some reason you
            prefer one over the other, we will gladly comply with your request.
            For us as for Cordova & PhoneGap app development company, there is
            barely any difference.
          </p>
          <p>
            Cordova and PhoneGap application development offer a lot of
            benefits, chiefly — convenience and universality. Yet, these
            solutions are not a panacea. PhoneGap and Cordova are perfect for
            prototyping or for internal business applications, which serve as
            add-ons, not the core of your business. However, if a mobile app is
            in the essence of your business, you should choose native
            development instead.
