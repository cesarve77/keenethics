        The story of our experience with indoor positioning service began when
        one of our top developers earned a PhD degree in indoor positioning and
        IoT technologies. A few years later, we have many projects in our
        portfolio and a lot of experience to share. We will be happy to help you
        implement indoor positioning technology and let your business grow.

        Aside from indoor positioning expertise, we specialize in web and mobile
        development. We will develop a custom web or mobile solution, which will
        make your indoor positioning system complete. Also, there is a Business
        Analyst in our team who specializes in the implementation of indoor
        positioning systems IPS — the one who came up with the idea for Asama.

        AData security is one of the major concerns associated with software
        development, particularly with indoor positioning and IoT technology.
        Using different testing approaches, pair programming, and external code
        review, our developers and QA specialists, together with security
        experts, make sure that the app is error-free and resistant to malicious
        attacks.

For instance, GPS technologies are not precise enough to locate people inside large buildings, such as airports, malls, or warehouses. And this is where indoor positioning comes into play. This technology offers a few ways for locating people and objects with one-meter accuracy. One of such ways is based on iBeacon — the technology developed by Apple, which employs BLE transmitters.',
      'ndoor positioning system is an IoT solution, which lets businesses efficiently locate their employees or customers and use this information for business development purposes. For example, indoor positioning in retail can help businesses advertise their products to the customers passing by their store. At the same time, indoor positioning in airports can help passengers find their way around the building and receive timely flight information. Meanwhile, indoor positioning in warehouses can help employers control their employees. The opportunities are indeed endless when you start thinking about it.',
