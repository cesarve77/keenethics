          Meteor is used to develop both server-side back end and client-side
          front end of a web platform or a native mobile app. This way, the
          entire application is written in pure JavaScript.

          <h2>What is Meteor JS development?</h2>
          <p>
            Meteor is an open sourced Node.js-based platform for web, mobile,
            and desktop app development. Initially released in 2012, Meteor
            shook the development world as a revolutionary framework. Unlike the
            vast majority of other JS frameworks, Meteor can be used for both
            back end and front end development regardless of what kind of app
            you want to develop — web, mobile, or desktop. This makes the
            development process more time-efficient and cost-efficient, and the
            entire app can be developed by the same team of software developers.
            Therefore, this framework perfectly suits rapid prototyping.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here at KeenEthics, about a half of all the projects have been
            developed with the usage of Meteor JS framework. Our leading
            developers and CTO himself have been supporting the open source
            community and trying to establish a Meteor development group here in
            Ukraine. While some may say that the glory days of Meteor are over,
            we will argue that they are definitely not. This framework is
            actively supported, and it deserves attention due to the benefits it
            offers.

              For businesses, this tool offers an important opportunity to
              evaluate corporate culture and employee satisfaction. SelfLeaders
