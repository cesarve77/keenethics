          <h2>The Agriculture Industry</h2>
          <p>
            Agriculture has turned from the most ancient craft into one of the most advanced industries of
            today. Have you read about vertical gardening, AI-powered vegetable picking, or precision
            agriculture? These concepts completely changed the lives of farmers. Today, technology is
            not a benefit anymore — it is a necessity for their business to thrive. Farm management
            software is as usual as an online store or an accounting platform.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here at KeenEthics, we are eager to assist them. We have experience in helping a few
            European farming companies to start working smarter and more efficiently. We believe that
            the agriculture industry desperately needs technological innovation — especially in the era
            when the shortage of food supply is not a possibility but a matter of time.

                The life of a farmer is so active — you do
                not have much time to spend in front of a
                computer.

                are more convenient, but also the
                development of a hybrid app is more
                efficient than of a native one.

            <h3 className="text-center">My Grass Growth</h3>
            <p>
              This web platform aims to facilitate the lives of farmers. Using a set of user data and
              specific formulas, the app prepares forecasts on grazing and mowing paddocks and
              feeding herds. This way, the farmer does not have to go around their huge fields and
              monitor the growth of grass — this function is perfectly performed by My Grass Growth.
              The farm management software is relatively simple in terms of UI, but
              instead, it offers a powerful tool for analytics.
