              <p>
                The owners of this website platform declare it to be an e-health digital hospital providing patients with comprehensive and high-quality medical care. Here, a user can request a consultation with any medical specialist.
              </p>

              <h4>The list of treatments offered includes:</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>cancer care</li>
                <li>cosmetic surgery</li>
                <li>weight loss surgeries</li>
                <li>hair treatment</li>
                <li>eye treatment</li>
                <li>fertility treatment</li>
                <li>orthopedic surgeries</li>
              </ul>

              <p>With a single button click, a patient chooses any of the treatment options offered. Then, they can request treatment prices, free advice, or a treatment brochure. Having provided a few details about their case, they are asked about their financial opportunities. After that, they are offered to arrange a free consultation with a medical specialist at any point in time they choose. Finally, they enter the postcode to receive more detailed medical information about locations and prices. If they have already completed patient registration in the hospital information system, final arrangements are made, and the appointment is scheduled.</p>
              <p>
                <b>The goal of the integrated hospital information management system is to transform the outdated, disorganized, and inefficient traditional system of healthcare.</b>
              </p>
              <p>This project is the first among ehospital systems with fully digitalized administrative practices for the sake of improved patient and healthcare provider experience. It revolutionizes the interaction between patients and hospitals, offers a highly personalized experience for each patient, and enables healthcare specialists to get rid of unnecessary administrative tasks and to focus on providing outstanding medical care instead.</p>

              <h2>Our Cooperation</h2>
              <h3>Challenges</h3>
              <p>
                The major challenge was associated with data security. Since users input a lot of personal information into the web platform, we had to ensure that it is safe and immune to data breaches.
              </p>
              <p>
                Another issue was associated with website loading speed since it features an immense database of medical data. Therefore, we had to integrate the database in a way that would not affect the performance of the platform.
              </p>
              <h3>Our Team</h3>
              <p>
                Two full-stack software developers and one Quality Assessment specialist have been working on developing front-end and back-end for this application and finding digital hospital solutions.
              </p>
              <h3>Technologies</h3>
              <p>This <Link href="/services-web-development">web platform</Link> has been developed with the use of <Link href="/tech-front-end-react">React</Link> and <Link href="/services-web-development-node">Node.js</Link>.</p>

              </ul>
              <h3>Methodology</h3>
              <p>
                We cooperated according to the principles of <Link href="/blog/how-to-choose-your-optimal-development-methodology">Scrum</Link> in order to ensure continuous communication and interaction with the client. This PM methodology proved to be the most efficient as long as the requirements were constantly updated, and the partner strove to be constantly involved in the development process.

              <h2>What Makes This Case Special?</h2>
              <p>
