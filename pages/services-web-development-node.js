          <p>
            Node.js is a free, open-source, cross-platform, runtime environment
            for JavaScript. It allows executing code outside a browser, which
            enables us to develop a sustainable, scalable, and
            resource-efficient application.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Node.js community has developed several server frameworks in
            order to accelerate the development process of apps and websites.
            Among such frameworks, there are Express.js, Meteor, Derby, and
            others. Thanks to a broad range of frameworks and libraries
            available, Node.js web development and Node.js application
            development have become the most efficient solution for various
            business goals. In fact, such popular websites as{" "}

              vehicle, and ParkQX aims to help them. Drivers can open the app,
              locate the nearest available spot, book it, and pay for it via
              app. At the same time, parking spot owners get a chance to earn
              some extra revenue while they do not use it by lending their spot
              to those who need it right now.
