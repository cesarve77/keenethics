          <h2>What Is Internet of Things?</h2>
          <p>
            Internet of Things revolutionizes the way people do business and organize
            their everyday life. Smart home systems spare you a huge share of house chores,
            smart speakers become the best person to talk to, and fitness trackers replace
            regular medical checks. IoT solutions are used for employee monitoring,
            resource tracking, and customer relationship management.
          </p>
          <p>
            An IoT solution consists of a hardware device and a software program, which
            are connected via the Internet. KeenEthics IoT specialists make sure that
            both components are effective, reliable, and secure.
