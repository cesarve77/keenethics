              <b>From the technical perspective...</b><br/>
              Indoor positioning is a 
              technology, which uses a network of devices to locate people or objects in such 
              places where GPS and other satellite technologies 
              cannot do it properly. For instance, GPS technologies 
              are not precise enough to locate people inside large 
              buildings, such as airports, malls, or warehouses. And this is where indoor positioning comes into play. This 
              technology offers a few ways for locating people and 
              objects with one-meter accuracy. One of such ways is 
              based on iBeacon — the technology developed by 
              Apple, which employs BLE transmitters.

              <b>From the business perspective...</b><br/>
              Indoor positioning system is an IoT solution, which lets 
              businesses efficiently locate their employees or 
              customers and use this information for business 
              development purposes. For example,&nbsp;
              <Link href="/blog/1554793200000-indoor-positioning-in-retail">
                <a>indoor positioning in retail</a>
              </Link>
              &nbsp;can help businesses advertise their 
              products to the customers passing by their store. At 
              the same time, indoor positioning in airports can help 
              passengers find their way around the building and 
              receive timely flight information. Meanwhile, indoor 
              positioning in warehouses can help employers control 
              their employees. The opportunities are indeed endless when 
              you start thinking about it.

            <h3 className="text-center">PREE</h3>
            <p>
              PREE is an IoT system for indoor positioning, which is implemented with BLE beacons and a mobile app. The goal of 
              PREE is to let users always know where their precious belongings are. The idea is simple. The user attaches a beacon 
              to their bag, laptop, car keys, or whatever they need. They add this device to their account in mobile app. Now, they 
              can always see in real time where their thing with a beacon attached to it is. There are a lot of opportunities for 
              customization: users can get notified when their items get out of range, share locations with a circle of trusted 
              people, or set a safe zone where notifications will not disturb them.

            <h3 className="text-center">Airport Showroom</h3>
            <p>
              The mobile app offers a showroom map to users where they can see all the necessary objects and facilities and the 
              optimal route towards them. The app can be downloaded via a QR code. Besides, the app allows admins to change 
              the map, routes, information, and so on allowing them to set up the system without developers help.
            </p>
            <p>
              Additionally, the admins can tag Bluetooth sensors with certain content making it appear to the users when they are 
              nearby. The user, for example, can get a message about special offers, promotions, and exclusive products when 
              going near Duty Free stores. They can also receive notifications from airlines about delays, issues, or promos. All 
              in all, it is a good place for both timely communications and ads.
