              <h2>Our Cooperation</h2>
              <h3>Challenges</h3>
              <p>
                The first and major challenge that the company underwent was associated with <b>a lack of resources</b>. This is why they chose us – an ethical hospital software development company with a fair pricing approach. Furthermore, with the help of our development, the company got a second round of investment.
              </p>
              <p>
                Besides, throughout hospital management software development, there was <b>a problem with service rendering</b>, and we managed to resolve it. We completed server bundling and solved a problem with Hot Module Replacement. This achievement has significantly improved the project architecture, which accelerated further hospital patient management software development.
              </p>

A team lead and developers working on the back-end of the hospital management software were provided from the client’s side.
