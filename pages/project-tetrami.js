              <p>
                While sales and discounts are major marketing strategies to increase sales and win
                customer loyalty, they are also a great chance for ordinary people to save a lot
                of money. People love discounts since they bring more satisfaction from shopping.
                Tetrami enables people to do what they love, so it is no surprise that the
                users love Tetrami back.
              </p>
              <p>
                Tetrami is a brand new “deal” shopping project with a unique discounting method,
                headquartered in King Of Prussia, PA, but serving the customers from all over
                the world. While Tetrami offers delivery only to the USA addresses, it does accept
                orders from international users on a condition they organize the shipping
                out of the United States on their own.

              <p>
                We have built the app from scratch, tested it, and deployed it. In fact, a great
                amount of work has been done as we optimized major app functions, and secured
                the online payment system. Moreover, Tetrami has decided to change horses midstream
                and go with an entirely different design and functionality. Eventually,
                we have managed to revamp and launch the app into production.
              </p>

              <h3 className="red-italic-title">Our Team</h3>
              <p>
                Our three leading software developers, one QA specialist, and one
                project manager have been helping Tetrami implement the idea.

              <p>
                We have used Kanban because the app has been developed from scratch, our team has
                been quite small. In addition, the customer has been eager to take
                an active part in the development process.

              <h2>What Makes Tetrami Special?</h2>
              <p>
                A customer chooses a product from the list of suggested ones. These products include
                but are not limited to various electronic devices, such as voice assistant speakers,
                electric dental brushes, cameras, TVs, wireless earphones, or home appliances, as
                well as jewelry, makeup, gift cards, and a lot of other popular items. The list of
                offered goods and services is regularly updated, so monitoring it carefully, people
                can find the product of their dream and try to purchase it with a
                considerable discount.
              </p>
              <p>
                To do so, a person creates a special 4-characters-long promo code, challenges
                other users, and watches the discount dynamically grow. The promo code is made
                of 4 given variables, and each time a different user offers another one that
                does not match, the challenger receives a certain discount.
              </p>
              <img
                src="/static/portfolio/tetrami/tetrami-content.jpg"
                alt="Tetrami"
                className="image-gaps"
              />
              <p>
                As soon as the user is satisfied, he or she can make a purchase at a bargain price.
                However, once someone else creates the same promo code, the challenger’s
                one becomes unavailable.
              </p>
              <p>
                Each user is given 50 chances per day to participate in challenges. Once they are
                out of lives, they can earn additional ones by watching adds, responding to surveys,
                or sharing invitations via social media. All the payments are processed via PayPal –
                a popular online payments system.
