          Vue.js has a smooth learning curve. The code is clean and easy to
          understand. A developer knowing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript can easily

          Vue.js is about only 20 KB and packed with extensions. Its source code
          consists of a single file component, which includes script, template,
          and style.

          VueJS development services can be used to build apps of any scale due
          to a simple minimal core with an adoptable stack. Vue has
          out-of-the-box components for almost everything and can be integrated
          with any app.

          Vue.js is often faster than React, and developers can easily integrate
          it with other libraries or existing projects. Its MVVM architecture
          allows to minimize HTML blocks and boost performance.

            of the Big Three JS frameworks for front-end development. Vue.js is

            , a former developer at Google, created Vue.js with the idea to take
            his favorite Angular concepts and features and build an innovative
            lightweight framework around them. This is why VueJS development
            services combine the best features of Angular and React: the code is
            clean and the app is fast and lightweight. This framework enables
            the swift development of a software product of any size without
            compromising performance or speed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Vue.js is well suitable for outstaffing or outsourcing of existing
            projects since this framework is easily approachable and
            understandable, scalable, and can be integrated with most projects
            and libraries. Also, Vue is ideal for&nbsp;
            <Link href="/approach-minimum-viable-product">MVP development</Link>
            &nbsp;as its setup and configuration do not take long and Vue.js
            developers do not need to spend extra hours on optimization.
            Besides, Vue.js and Nuxt.js — a framework built on top of Vue ― are

              quick and responsive for the employees to conveniently use it. As
