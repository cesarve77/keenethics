        <h2>What Is Express.js?</h2>
        <p>Express.js is the most popular and efficient Node.js framework, which is fully customizable in terms of both the development process and the final app. It offers numerous built-in features, which means the developer does not have to write them from scratch but uses ready-made templates and saves a great deal of time. Express.js considerably assists in keeping the code clean and organized. </p>
        <p>Express.js does not contradict but rather complements the functionality of Node.js. It offers a robust list of features, which includes content negotiation, robust routing, application view options, environment-based configuration, dynamic view helpers, and session-based flash notifications.</p>
        <p>Therefore, this server-side framework is actively used for both back-end and front-end <a href="/services-web-development" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">web app development</a> and <a href="/services-mobile-development" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">mobile app development</a>. Due to the advantages and opportunities it provides, the popularity of Express.js is expected to grow.</p>
        <p>Popular websites such as <a href="https://www.paypal.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Paypal</a>, <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Yahoo!</a>, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Wall Street Journal Online</a>, <a href="https://www.groupon.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Groupon</a>, <a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Shutterstock</a>, and <a href="https://myspace.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">MySpace</a>, are powered by Express.js.</p>
